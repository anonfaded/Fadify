# Fadify

Fadify is a Firefox extension that adds **live theme customization** to ChatGPT.  
Itâ€™s built with an object-oriented, containerized design â€” each supported website will live in its own folder for styling, so adding more websites later wonâ€™t clutter the codebase.

---

## Features
- ðŸŽ¨ Live theme switching (applies instantly, no page reload required)  
- ðŸ—‚ Containerized design (each website has its own folder and logic)  
- ðŸ”® Currently supports **ChatGPT** (more websites planned)  
- âš¡ Simple popup UI to select themes  
- ðŸŒ™ **4 Themes Available**: Default, Dark, Aqua, and **Faded Night** (pitch black)
