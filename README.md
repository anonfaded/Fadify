# Fadify

Fadify is a Firefox extension that adds **live theme customization** to ChatGPT (and more sites soon).  
Each supported destination lives inside its own **lab** folder, keeping styles and scripts modular so adding the next website stays tidy.

---

## Features
- ðŸŽ¨ Live theme switching (applies instantly, no page reload required)  
- ðŸ§ª Lab-based architecture (each website has its own folder and logic)  
- ðŸ”® Currently supports **ChatGPT** (more labs planned)  
- âš¡ Simple popup UI to select themes  
- ðŸŒ™ **4 Themes Available**: Default, Dark, Aqua, and **Faded Night** (pitch black)
